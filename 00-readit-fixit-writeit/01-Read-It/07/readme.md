* Look at the documentation of the map() function
    * The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

* What's the difference between this and the previous exercise?
    * It's the same logic, only here everything is first generated to a NEW ARRAY for each movie, and then continues as it was the previous exercise. So it's generated from movie to movie to movie, instead of just based from the array in it's whole if that makes sense !
