* The for-loop is no longer present. 
  What was it replaced with? How does this work?
    * it has been replaced with const ! You can always change the i and it's declaration later with for-loop. const is a constant so it will give an error if you want to change this later. 

* What does the function 'parseTitle' do? 
What parameter do we pass to this function?
  * (Parsing means analyzing and converting a program into an internal format that a runtime environment can actually run). When the HTML parser finds non blocking resources, the browser will request those resources and continue parsing. 
  the parameter here is TITLE 

* What does the function 'wrapWithTag' do? 
  Why are the parameters placed between brackets?
    *wrapWithTag makes it possible to wrap strings with HTML. A wrapper is a function that can call one or more functions. 
    It is put between brackets because you use several elements with the getElementById function $().
