# FIX IT
## EX 03
* Why are we not seeing any tv shows? Look at the error message in the dev tools and solve it.
    *error: Uncaught ReferenceError: movies is not defined
    *solution : ez, replace movies with tvshows as this is the constant that we use.
* Try to display the list on the screen in reversed order. (without adjusting the original array)
    * keep array as it is, replace movies with tvshows in document.write() function and your good to go !
